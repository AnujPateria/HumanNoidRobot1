## 📖 Overview

**Kritrim** is an affordable, emotion-aware humanoid robot designed to empower MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) and public service desks.

Unlike existing global solutions that cost between ₹20-60 Lakh, Kritrim provides an **indigenous, modular alternative costing significantly less (approx. ₹5-7 Lakh)**. It is engineered to automate repetitive tasks—such as answering FAQs, providing directions, and greeting visitors—while bridging language barriers through advanced multilingual NLP.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **🗣️ Multilingual Support:** Communicates fluently in English, Hindi, and regional languages to assist diverse demographics.
* **🎭 Emotion AI:** Detects user tone, pitch, and facial expressions to provide empathetic and consistent service.
* **👁️ AI Vision:** Capable of detecting customers and analyzing surroundings for better interaction using Computer Vision.
* **📉 Cost-Effective Hardware:** Built using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, making it accessible for small businesses.
* **📶 Offline Capability:** Designed to function effectively even without consistent internet connectivity.
